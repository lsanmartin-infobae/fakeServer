Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. </p>",

However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>",
